# Security Audit Report - Inbound Email Application

## Executive Summary
This security audit was conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities and security improvements for the Inbound email infrastructure application. The audit covers authentication, API security, input validation, and general security best practices.

## Audit Findings

### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

#### 1. Missing Security Headers
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** The application lacks essential security headers that protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- No Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- No X-Frame-Options
- No X-Content-Type-Options
- No Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- No Referrer-Policy

**Impact:** Application is vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing attacks, and other security issues.

#### 2. Weak HTML Sanitization
**Severity:** High  
**Location:** `lib/email-management/email-parser.ts`  
**Description:** The current HTML sanitization is basic regex-based and may not catch all XSS vectors.

**Impact:** Potential XSS attacks through email content.

#### 3. Missing CSRF Protection
**Severity:** High  
**Description:** No CSRF protection implemented for state-changing operations.

**Impact:** Cross-site request forgery attacks possible.

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Issues

#### 4. Incomplete Webhook Signature Validation
**Severity:** Medium  
**Location:** `app/api/inbound/webhook/route.ts`  
**Description:** While webhook signatures are generated, there's no validation on incoming webhooks to verify authenticity.

**Impact:** Webhook endpoints could be called by unauthorized parties.

#### 5. Basic Rate Limiting
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** Rate limiting exists in the database schema but is not consistently enforced across all API endpoints.

**Impact:** API abuse and potential DoS attacks.

#### 6. Environment Variable Exposure
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** No centralized environment variable validation, potential for missing required variables at runtime.

**Impact:** Application crashes or security misconfigurations.

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Issues

#### 7. CORS Configuration
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** CORS is configured but allows credentials with specific origins. Should be reviewed for production needs.

**Impact:** Potential for unintended cross-origin access.

#### 8. Missing Input Validation Middleware
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Input validation is done ad-hoc in each endpoint rather than through centralized middleware.

**Impact:** Inconsistent validation, potential for missed edge cases.

## Positive Security Findings âœ…

1. **Authentication System**: Using Better Auth with proper session management and API key support
2. **Database Queries**: Using Drizzle ORM which provides protection against SQL injection
3. **Password Storage**: Passwords are properly hashed (handled by Better Auth)
4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Application uses HTTPS in production
5. **Sentry Integration**: Error monitoring and tracking implemented

## Recommendations & Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Security Headers (Immediate)
1. Implement comprehensive security headers in Next.js config
2. Add Content Security Policy
3. Enable HSTS for production

### Phase 2: Input Validation & Sanitization (High Priority)
1. Replace regex-based HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
2. Implement Zod validation schemas for all API endpoints
3. Create validation middleware

### Phase 3: API Security (Medium Priority)
1. Implement proper rate limiting middleware
2. Add webhook signature validation
3. Implement CSRF protection

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Security (Ongoing)
1. Create environment variable validation schema
2. Implement security monitoring and alerting
3. Regular dependency updates

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Security headers and HTML sanitization
- **Week 2**: Input validation and rate limiting
- **Week 3**: Webhook security and CSRF protection
- **Week 4**: Testing and monitoring setup
