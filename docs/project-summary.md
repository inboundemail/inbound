- **Reply Handling**: Intelligent email threading and auto-reply capabilities

### 2. **Domain & Address Management**
- **Custom Domains**: Add and verify your own email domains
- **Email Addresses**: Create unlimited email addresses on verified domains
- **Catch-All Support**: Route all emails to specific domains through catch-all functionality
- **DNS Management**: Automated MX record setup and verification

### 3. **Webhook & Endpoint System**
- **Unified Endpoints**: Single configuration for webhooks, email forwarding, and email groups
- **Webhook Verification**: Signed webhooks with payload verification
- **Delivery Tracking**: Comprehensive logging of all email deliveries and webhook calls
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed deliveries

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
- **Email Infrastructure**: AWS SES with Lambda processors
- **Cloud**: AWS CDK for infrastructure as code
- **Package Manager**: Bun (exclusively)

### **Key Dependencies**
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with custom components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Authentication**: Better Auth with session management
